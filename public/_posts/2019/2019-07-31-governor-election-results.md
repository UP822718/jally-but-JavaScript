As part of our Constitution, we have to maintain a board to provide oversight to the NEC. Board Members must be elected by the party and re-elected every few years.

It is with great pleasure I can announce that Jason Halsey has succesfully been elected to the position of Governor, leaving two vacant positions which we hope to open nominations to fill within the coming weeks. There is also an open position on the NEC as Nominations Officer, an important role that is vital for the smooth running of the party during election period.

Volunteering for the party doesn't have to be in an elected role, there are plenty of ways to get involved from proof-reading articles to helping produce marketing material for the party. Swing by our Discord and have a chat if you think that you might be able to lend a hand.


## About the Pirate Party ##

The Pirate Party in the UK is a fledgling political party. It has fielded a few candidates in European and National elections, but like most small parties it is significantly constrained by the UK electoral system. Despite this, the Pirate Party has started to poll alongside major parties and is looking to build support from the grassroots. The party stood 10 candidates in the June 2017 General Election and briefly held 2 community councillors.
