# How to get involved in the development of pirateparty.org.uk

**Basic structure**:

- [Jekyll][] generates static pages
- Template in HTML using [Liquid][]
- The source code itself is HTML5
  - Styles are written in SASS and built with [Foundation][]
  - JS uses Jquery and Foundation
- Source code is at [Github][Github]
- Issues and tasks are logged on our [Github issues][] page (feel free to pick one up!)

The technology stack was chosen as it presents a mix of versatile technology with an approachable learning cure.

**Getting involved**
If you're new to web development, you should consider learning the following:

1. in general HTML 5 (HTML, JS, CSS), JQuery
2. git (protocol) and github
3. Jekyll basics

This should give you enough understanding ot allow you to tackle minor bugs, write new pages, and manage clean-up tasks of existing pages

For more advanced contributions, you will want to understand how gulp works, as well as how Jekyll structures sites and handles templating, features that make Jekyll far more powerful than a typical blog platform.
