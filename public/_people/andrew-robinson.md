Andy Robinson founded the Pirate Party UK in 2009 and was the party's first leader. Andy represented the party primarily on issues around copyright, asking "I'd dearly like to know where all this money is meant to be?" when opposition claimed piracy was costing the creative arts heavily.

Since then, Andy has occupied a seat on the Board of Governors, and was Chair of the Board between x and x.
