Rebecca Sentance is the Press Lead and London Branch Leader for Pirate Party UK.

She first became interested in Pirate politics after backing the documentary TPB:AFK (The Pirate Bay: Away From Keyboard) in 2010 and learning about the Pirate Party movement. In 2014 after moving to London she joined the London branch of the Party, and has been involved ever since, going door-to-door with leaflets in the 2015 and 2017 elections and helping to manage PPUK's online presence as a press officer. In 2018 she took on the role of London Branch Leader.

A journalist by day, she is also an enthusiastic fanworks creator and advocate for transformative works, and volunteers with the Organization for Transformative Works (OTW). She can be found on Twitter at @rainbowbex.
