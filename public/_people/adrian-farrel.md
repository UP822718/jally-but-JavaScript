Adrian Farrel was elected to the PPUK Board in 2015 and became Chair on 14th
December 2016. He is an Internet technologist active in the Internet
Engineering Task Force and running Old Dog Consulting. He has written
several technical reference books on Internet protocols, and four volumes of
fairy stories for adults of all ages which are published under a Creative
Commons license.

Adrian's interests in PPUK cover the impact of the Internet and technology
on society, the importance of Internet access as a human right, the
desperate need for our education system to embrace teaching of technology at
all ages, and the tension between civil liberties and protection that
manifests in facial recognition and ubiquitous digital surveillance.

Given the choice, Adrian would like the Pirate Party to be a dominant
movement so that he could sit back and watch the world evolve into a better
place.
